[Atomes][atomes] is a Free (Open Source) cross-platform toolbox developed to analyze, to visualize and to edit/create three-dimensional atomistic models.
It oﬀers a workspace that allows to have many projects opened simultaneously.

The different projects in the workspace can exchange data: analysis results, atomic coordinates ...
Atomes also provides an advanced input preparation system for further calculations using well known molecular dynamics codes:

Classical MD : DLPOLY and LAMMPS
ab-initio MD : CPMD and CP2K
QM-MM MD : CPMD and CP2K

To prepare the input ﬁlles for these calculations is likely to be the key, and most complicated step towards MD simulations. Atomes offers a user-friendly assistant to help and guide the user step by step to achieve this crucial step.
